                The villa in Cote d’Azur had been confiscated in 2006, but eight years later its owner, a known offender, was still renting it out on Airbnb. The story of this real estate asset is just the tip of the iceberg of a phenomenon that embraces the whole of Europe. In 2014 goods worth more than two billion euros were taken away from the hands of criminal groups in Italy, Germany, Spain, France, England and Wales. It is an amount that rises to four billion euros if we include all EU countries: each with its own legislations and languages, while mafias and criminal groups speak only the language of dirty business, which help them create an annual wealth estimated at 110 billion euros.
                </p>
                <p>
                Drugs and arms trafficking, prostitution, fiscal frauds, rackets and money laundering are just some of the economic activities engaged in by criminals which affect the lives of European citizens and disrupt legal business operations. However, just a small share of this vast fortune is effectively taken away from crime groups through the confiscation of the proceeds of crime.
                </p>
                <p>
                Over the last decade the European Union has started to fight back against those activities. The transnational nature of criminal investments and the presence of ‘liquid’ crime groups , which are able to adapt to different situations and overcome any legislative hurdle, required an intervention from the European authorities. 
                </p>
                <p>
                The freezing and confiscation of assets and proceeds of crime has become a priority in the EU battle against organised crime. “The EU’s internal security strategy” aims to hit the criminals where it hurts the most, by taking away their money, villas and luxurious boats. Following the introduction of five legislative acts aimed at improving the confiscation and recovery of goods, in February 2014 the EU Parliament approved new rules to confiscate and freeze the proceeds of crime with 631 votes in favour, 19 against and 25 abstensions.
                </p>

                <p>The measures, which should be transposed by member states into national laws within 30 months, include the possibility to confiscate assets even if the suspect is not present in court eg. in absentia. Another feature introduced by the directive is the possibility to use confiscated assets for public interest or social purposes, as it already happens in Italy thanks to the Act 109/1996. The directive also provides for the possibility of an extended confiscation, in which assets are removed from criminal groups even if they are not associated with a specific crime but are deemed to constitute the proceeds of other crimes. The list includes active and passive corruption in the private sector involving officials of institutions of the Union or of the Member States, the affiliation to organised crime groups, the distribution, dissemination or transmission of child pornography and a range of cyber crimes.
                </p>

                <p>
                The directive established that every member state would have to share data on confiscated assets with the European Commission. The goal is the creation of an European database, which can help national governments shape a coherent strategy in their fight against mafia-style organisations. Getting to know the data on the investments of crime groups and on confiscation is of paramount importance. In the absence of reliable numbers, it is impossible to assess the effectiveness of the policies aimed at tackling criminal assets and promoting their use for social purposes. Additionally, in countries like France and Spain where the sale of confiscated assets is preferred, it is not always possible to measure the economic benefits of such initiatives.
                </p>

                <p>In autumn 2015 a team of journalists launched an investigation called “Confiscated Goods”, the european chapter of “Confiscati Bene”, a project of investigative journalism and civic monitoring advocating transparency on confiscated assets in Italy. The goal is to incentivize the creation of an European database of confiscated assets, which will allow a clear and timely answer to the questions of how many, where and which kinds of assets are taken away from criminals in Europe.
                </p>
                <h4>Where the law on confiscation is weaker</h4>
                <p class="lead">
                In all European countries there is a law on the confiscation of proceed of crime or criminal assets. In most of the EU28 there is a law on the management of seized assets. But only in ten countries, including Italy and the United Kingdom, you can also confiscate property without a criminal conviction.
                And only in 12 countries, the law provides a direct social reuse of goods. Here you may find the Audit of EU countries: it shows who of those has/hasn't laws to manage confiscations and in which way they do it.

                <h3>Confiscated assets are worth almost 4 billion euros a year</h3>
                <p>The data currently available Europe-wide does not allow to paint a complete picture on the matter of confiscated goods. Aside from some national information, there is a lack of stats detailing the extent to which member states are able to recover illicit assets and cash. 
                </p>
                <p>
                It is hard to estimate the true size of the criminal wealth that ends up in the control of the State. Therefore, our investigation focussed on five main European countries, each with its own peculiarities when it comes to confiscation and freezing of assets. 
                </p>
                <p>
                Overall, Italy, France, Spain, Germany, England and Wales confiscated more than two billion euros worth of assets in the last year for which the data has been made available. The number derives from the analysis of stats produced by the Assets Recovery Offices (ARO) or by national Ministries of Interior and Justice. The total value of confiscations enforced across the whole of Europe amounts to four billion euros.
